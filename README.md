# Application of Transformer Models for Demand Forecasting in the FMCG Industry

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and documentation related to the research project focused on enhancing demand forecasting in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry using advanced transformer models. The objective of this project is to improve forecasting accuracy by integrating external data sources and leveraging transformer models.

## Key Components

### Methodology
- **Data Integration**: Combining internal shipment and consumption data with external data sources such as Google Trends and Amazon reviews.
- **Modeling**: Implementing transformer models (iTransformer and TimesNet) for time-series forecasting and demand sensing.
- **Evaluation**: Comparing the performance of the models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- **External Data Sources**: Google Trends, Amazon Reviews

### Model Training
Scripts and notebooks for training the transformer models, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

### Results
- Comparison of model performance on various data sets.
- Insights gained from integrating external factors into the forecasting models.
